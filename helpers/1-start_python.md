**Welcome to PythonAnywhere!**
Up here you will see instructions that will walk you through the basic use of
PythonAnywhere and some very basic Python programming to get you started.

You can go forward and back through the steps using the
arrow buttons below, and you can finish at any time by clicking the cross in
the top right.  If after closing this helper, you want to go through it again
--- or try another one -- go to the **Help** page, by following
the link above and to the right.

Click the right arrow when you're ready.

----


This page is your **Dashboard**.  It has a number of tabs (below),
each of which contains a separate section of PythonAnywhere.  This tutorial
will walk you through the most important ones.  You can
get to the Dashboard from anywhere you are in PythonAnywhere using the
link near the top right of the page, or by clicking
the PythonAnywhere logo in the top left.

Right now, we're on the **Consoles** tab. Consoles are places where you can
type in commands in a programming language, and get an immediate response from
the computer. The next step will show you how to use one.

----

Click on the **2.7** link just just under the **Start new console** heading;
this will start Python version 2.7, which is a good version to start off with.
After a little while, you should see a console with a "prompt" that looks like
this:

    >>>

This is the standard Python "interactive interpreter". It's also sometimes called
the REPL (which stands for Read, Evaluate and Print Loop), or a CLI (Command
Line Interpreter). Here you can enter
Python and it will be run immediately.  Let's try that in the next step.

----

Try typing `print "Hello, world"` and hitting Enter. Your console should now
look like this

    >>> print "Hello, world"
    Hello, world
    >>>

So, you told Python to print out the message "Hello, world", and it did so
straight away.

----

Now that you know how to start a Python interpreter, you might be wondering how
you can write programs that are more permanent than the lines you typed into
the interpreter.

For that, we need to learn about files on PythonAnywhere.

Return to your **Dashboard** by clicking the link at the top right of the page,
or by clicking the PythonAnywhere logo at the top left.

----

To create a more permanent program, we'll need to create a file to hold it.
Click on the **Files** tab below.

You are now looking at your home directory on PythonAnywhere.

To create a Python file, type `helloworld.py` into the text box that says
`Enter new file name` then click the **New** button next to it.

----

The code editor will open up.  This is where you can enter programs
that will be saved in files. Type this into it:

    print "Hello, world. Again"

Click "Save" at the top right to save your program and then return to your
**Dashboard**.

----

Now we're going to start a different kind of console. Click on the **Bash**
link under the **Start new console** heading. Bash is a shell that allows you
to run all sorts of programs that are installed on PythonAnywhere. In this
case, we're going to use it to run the program you just wrote. Type

    python helloworld.py

and you should see it print out

    Hello, world. Again.

----

We've now walked you through the very basics of using PythonAnywhere to learn
Python. There are a number of extremely good tutorials on the web and you
should now be able to follow them on PythonAnywhere. Here are some of our favorites:

 * [The Official Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/) (You can skip sections 1 and 2)
 * [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) (Where there is a choice, follow the instructions for Linux)

There is also [a big list of python tutorials](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/NonProgrammers) on the Python wiki.

If you already know some programming have a look at:

 * [Dive into Python](http://www.diveintopython.net/)

Good luck on your journey into the world of Python!
